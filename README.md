# noughts-and-crosses

This is the 'tic-tac-toe' task from The Odin Project. By completing this task I will learn how to use factory functions and modules. In addition, I will also start using IIFEs, and write cleaner code. This project will start using arrow functions as I have been lazy up until now in not using them.
